Note that whoever implemented the timezone support in Windows was on drugs. 
I'm not kidding you. Look at the timezone names. 
Why is Central European time known as "Romance standard Time". 
Romance? 
What, because it includes Paris, or? 
Roman Standard Time could have made sense a it also includes Rome, but Romance!?

Also, in the registry the timezones are not organized under their id. 
No, they are, insanely, organized under their display name! 
Since that is localized, it means every timezone will be located under a different key in different translations of Windows!!! 
So to find the right timezone, you have to look through all the timezone to see which has the correct id.

I wonder if it is the same guy who designed this that decided that POSIX should reverse the sign on timezones, 
so that -8 hours mean plus 8 hours. 
In any case, I'm sure they were smoking something illegal together.
